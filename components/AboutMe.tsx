                            technology since I was a child, thanks to my love for video games.</p>

                        <p>I am naturally curious and always eager to learn more. Recently, I created CoinTastic,
                            a web application that allows users to track real-time cryptocurrency prices using NextJS.</p>

                        <p>My passion for web development has led me to gain experience in various settings,
                            including working on personal projects as well as professional experiences at different companies,
                            where I have honed my skills in coding and problem-solving.</p>

                        <p>I am currently looking for an Apprenticeship contract !</p>

                        <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
                        <ul className="skills">
                            {skills.map((skill) => (
                                <li key={skill} className="flex items-center gap-2 mono font-extralight text-[13px]">
                                    <span><RxTriangleRight size={20} className="text-elem-purple" /></span>
                                    {skill}</li>
                            ))}
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
